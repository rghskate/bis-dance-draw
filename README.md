## BIS Dance Draw Randomised

A very simple program to ensure reproducibility of pattern dance draws at Ice Dance events.

Requires a list of pattern dances provided as a JSON and the details of the segments to take place at the competition it is being used to draw for. The `2425_dances.json` is an example of the former whilst the JSON files in `competitions\2425` are examples of the latter.
